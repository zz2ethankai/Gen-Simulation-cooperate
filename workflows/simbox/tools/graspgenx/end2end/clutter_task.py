"""Clutter pick-and-drop driver — Task D.

This module orchestrates a multi-object pick-and-drop sequence:

    For each object in the FIFO queue:
      1. Run GraspGenX inference on the object's mesh.
      2. Plan an approach + grasp + close + lift trajectory via cuRobo,
         with the OTHER objects (not yet dropped) registered as cuboid
         obstacles in the planner's world model.
      3. Drive the dynamic sim through the pick segments.
      4. Read the object's world pose at the end of the lift segment;
         if it has risen by ≥ LIFT_SUCCESS_DZ from its initial z, the
         grasp succeeded.
      5. On success: plan_pose to above the bin, drive the sim through
         the transport + open + hold segments, drop the object. Then
         return the arm to home.
         On failure: re-queue the object, return the arm to home, move
         on. After all objects have been tried, retry the failed ones
         up to a per-object retry cap.

The big design lever: a single :class:`DynamicSession` (built once)
holds the Newton model + state. Each call to ``session.drive_segments``
appends to a single growing frames buffer. After the queue is empty,
we call ``session.export`` to write one big trajectory JSON the
renderer consumes.

cuRobo's MotionPlanner is rebuilt per pick so the obstacle set reflects
which objects are still on the table. This adds 10–20 s per pick on
first run, but warmup is cached on subsequent rebuilds so it's manageable
(<5 s typical). The cost is acceptable for the demo's clarity.
